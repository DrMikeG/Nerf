NPN transistors whenever we need to control medium-power electronics such as small motors, solenoids, or IR LEDs. We find them so handy, they come in a pack of 10

Built a two transistor switch.

There is a pnp transistor with a resister across the switch.

I provide +6V to either side of the switch.

The PNP base lead is white.
I connect this to the Collector of the NPN transistor (right leg, viewing flat side)
I connect the emitter to the negative of the 6V supply
I also make a common ground with the arduino to the 6V ground.

The base of the PNP transistor is connected to arduino +5V via a parallel pair of 10K resistors.

You do have to power the 6V board!
