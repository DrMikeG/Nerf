Belatedly starting a working log.

Wired up the power switching for the gun motors onto the same perf board as the 12V - 6V convertor.

There are two red input leads requiring 12Volts, which get their power from to sockets on the small 5V convertor board.

There are two long socketed fly leads (white and black) coming of the board.
There is a short green pin lead (test +6V)
If you connect the White lead to the green lead, and all is well, the motor should power up. The black need is not required, as there is no need for a common earth in the test setup.

You can also connect the white and black leads to a PWM pin on the servo board, and power up the motors that way.

Using the servo test sketch, the PVM pulse widths for 'home' and 'fire' are:

//setServoAngle(65); // This is a good home value 258
pwm.setPWM(0, 0, 258);

Serial.println("Fire!");
pwm.setPWM(0, 0, 125); // This seems to be about the minimum where the dart gets cleanly picked up

The cyclic rate for the flywheel spin up is ~5 seconds, which is a bit disappointing.

Whilst looking a mod-kits, I discovered that Nerf make the Rapid Strike 
which is fully-automatic 18-shot rifle.

This makes me think I should be using that as a platform!
